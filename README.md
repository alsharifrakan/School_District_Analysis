# **School_District_Analysis**

## **Overview of the Analysis:**

Because of suspected academic dishonesty a school board has hired your consulting firm to analyze student data.
the board requested to provide the following:
- The District summary
- The School summary
- Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
- The average math score for each grade level from each school
- The average reading score for each grade level from each school
- The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type
- A report that summarizes your updated analysis

"NaN" which means Not a Number.
